== INTRODUCTION ==

Simpleds is a collection of data structures (and some associated algorithms)
implemented in plain, portable C code.  The main considerations in
implementing these data structures are as follows:

  1. Portability:
     These data structures should not depend on external libraries which are
     not part of the standard C library unless absolutely required.  Within
     the code itself interdependencies shall be kept to a minimum.  It should
     be easy to remove code from the project and drop it into (modifying as needed)
     whatever project the user is currently working on.

  2. Correctness:
     If the library is to be usable it must be correct.  A central part of simpleds
     is the unit tests (this project uses check as a unit testing framework).  Beyond
     the unit tests, effort has been taken to reference known-working implementations
     of data structures.

  3. Ease of Use (consistency):
     The interfaces for the simpleds modules are inspired and often match the
     interfaces found in the python collections module (and standard library).
     To the extent possible, the naming and calling conventions for implemented
     modules shall be consistent and intuitive for any moderately well-versed
     C programmer.

== INSTALLATION ==

Simpleds can be compiled into either a statically or dynamically linked library,
but we expect the most common usage of the library will be for modules to be
copied from simpleds and used in individuals own projects.  The code is licensed
under a very pervasive MIT-style license, we only ask that the header for each of
the files remains intact.

For building and working on the project, we use the scons build system.  Read up
on scons and checkout out the SConstruct file.  To build the tests you will need
the check unit testing library on your system.  If you are on ubuntu 9.10+ you 
can simply run:

    $ sudo apt-get install check
